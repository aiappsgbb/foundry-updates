      <description>The latest and most capable third-generation embeddings model for converting text into vectors for similarity and retrieval. It supports a dimensions parameter to reduce embedding size for cost/performance control, and shows improved multilingual retrieval performance (MIRACL) and strong English performance (MTEB). It cannot be upgraded to from older embeddings without regenerating embeddings.</description>
